Problem: We have a bunch of servers which serve videos. Each of these servers logs when ever the number of concurrent plays changes. To be more explicit each server generates a log file like this:

Server 1:
//Timestamp number_of_concurrent_plays
01:00 3
03:15 20
05:01 2

Server 2:
02:00 10
03:15 7
04:00 3

============

Weâ€™re trying to generate the total number of concurrent plays, so it should be the combination of the two files. i.e.:

01:00 3
02:00 13
03:15 27
04:00 23
05:01 5
