A given integer n is said to be a Ramanujan Number iff it satisfies

n  = (a)^3 + (b)^3
   = (c)^3 + (d)^3

where a, b, c, and d are all distinct integers greater than 0. e.g.

1729 = (1)^3 + (12)^3 and
1729 = (9)^3 + (10)^3

4104 = (2)^3 + (16)^3 and
4104 = (9)^3 + (15)^3

Write a function that takes in an integer and returns whether that integer is a Ramanujan Number.
