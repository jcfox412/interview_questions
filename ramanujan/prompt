A given integer n is said to be a Ramanujan Number iff it satisfies

n  =  (a)^3 + (b)^3  =  (c)^3 + (d)^3,

where a, b, c, and d are all integers greater than 0. e.g. 1729 = (1)^3 + (12)^3  =  (9)^3 + (10)^3.

Write a function that takes in an integer and returns whether that integer is a Ramanujan Number.
